# 6502Emu - by Eli Moore

A personal project where I am creating a from-scratch emulator for a 6502-based computer.
Right now, the application includes basic 6502 instructions that can be read in through a binary file (Which can be created through my .txt to .bin file converter) that includes the opcodes for the instructions. Soon, I will have an assembler that would take in a .asm file and convert into opcodes for quick assembly development. The emulator currently runs with a debugger that monitors memory locations, flags, etc. 

I am using github as a project organiser, so on the Projects and Issues tab, you can see what I am currently working on and what I will be implementing in the future. So far this project is only being created by me in Visual Studio C++, and I am using no external libraries (at the moment). I hope to keep this as strictly from-scratch work, but in the future, I might use the Win32 api or other apis to help with creating a GUI or optimized debugger. 

I am hoping for this to evolve into a full computer emulator (with graphics and sound), either emulating the NES, or a commodore-like machine of my own creation.

Full readme will be updated soon.
